## Device Details

* Device address 98
* Address type 7-bit
* Little Endian

## Registers

### EEPROM
**EEPROM**
* Address 96
* 12-bytes

If EEPROM is set, the saved voltage output will
be loaded from power-on.


### VOut
**Output voltage**
* Address 64
* 12-bytes

Sets the output voltage relative to Vcc.
VOut = (Vcc * value) / 4096.
The output is a range between 0 and Vcc with
steps of Vcc/4096.
In a 3.3v system, each step is 800 microvolts.


## Fields
### #/registers/EEPROM/digitalOut
**Digital (binary) output**

* Bits 12:0


#### Field values

* **0**: Ground
* **4095**: Vcc (full power)

Set output as either fully on or fully off.



## Functions

* **getVOut**: Read VOut from EEPROM as a function of Vcc.
* **setVOut**: Set VOut as a function of Vcc.
